# vim-loader
### Purpose

vim-loader is created for those who are trying to transition from using an IDE to VSCode. I recently transitioned to being a vim only coder recently and the experience is immaculate. The program sets up vim for the user in a way where they can get started on vim within seconds.

**`Unix/Linux`**
Run the following commands in your terminal

    cd ~/
    git clone git@github.com:VanshSharma14/vim-loader.git
    cd vim-loader
    bash init.sh

### Inspiration
For a while now I have been wanting to contribute to the open-source community however, I felt rather in-experienced when compared to the work required to contribute to a lot of large scale open-source projects. My goal behind vim-loader was to work on a largely expandable open-source project while also learning something new.
PS: vim-loader uses a vim-config almost completely identical to my own.

### Future of vim-loader
* Support for Windows
* Extended support of [`oh-my-zsh`](https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh) and [`tmux`](https://github.com/tmux/tmux)
